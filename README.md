MFC data logging device

The device monitors the voltage from 4 microbial fuel cells, voltage generated by bacterial activity near the electrodes in each cell.
The microbial fuel cells are connected to an analog to an ADS115 digital converter module (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-16-bit-ADC-ADS1115). 
The A/D converter is connected to a Raspberry Pi that runs a python script
